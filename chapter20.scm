; This isn't Functional Programming
; A function computes and returns 1 value, with no side effects
; A procedure is the general term for the thing that lambda returns(the
; embodiement of an algorithm). 

; Not moving to the next line:
(define (show-addition x y)
  (display x)
  (display '+)
  (display y)
  (display '=)
  (show (+ x y)))

; show is written from  newline and display. Display shows the specified
; object on the current line and does not change to a new one by itself.

; we can replace the '() in our original with (newline) and the cons and
; lists with (display) and (show).

; this is not a higher order function as it is the computations that we are
; performing with it have side-effects as an integral part of the computing.
; Scheme has for-each which is kind of like map, as the standard implementation
; of this type of procedure, though it has an unspecified return value. You
; can't use map it returns a list with three unspecified values.
