; accumulate takes a procedure(the first argument) and applies it to a sentence(the second argument) two words at a time. It continues to apply the procedure to the result and the next element in the sentence. It finishes when it has combined all of the words into a single result. That is the real power of this function, in that it takes all of the words of a sentence and combines them into a single meaningful(hopefully) result.

; repeated is a procedure that takes a procedure and a (positive?) integer as inputs. It outputs a procure that is the application of the input proceducre the input number of times.

;(repeated sqrt 3) This is a function that takes any number as an input and outputs a another number that is the 3rd square root of it. That is, it takes the square root of the input number, then takes the square root of that, then finally returns the square root of that.

; (repeated even? 2) This procedure will not function correctly, as it is trying to apply the even? procedure twice. However the output of the even? procedure is a boolean value and it expects an integer as the input.

;(repeated first 2) This procedure will take a word or sentence and output a word. If you give it a word it will return the first letter of the word, as the first letter of one letter is that letter. If the input is a sentence it will output the first letter of the first word, as it first applies the the first procedure to the sentence returning the first word. Then it applies the first procedure to that word. 

; (repeated (repeated bf 3) 2) This procedure will return all but the first six words of sentence and or all but the first six letters of word. The input can be either a word or sentence, and the output will be respective to the input.

; CHAPTER 16 IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS

; 16.8 If the sentence is empty, it first looks to see what the minimum
; value is. If there is no minimum(that is, min = 0), then it adds the
; blank sentence, '(), to the known values and returns the results from
; giving the rest of the pattern to `match-using-known-values`. If the
; minimum is one, then it returns failed.

; 16.9 Pattern = '(evil *one dog) '(evil tubby dog ran)

; 16.10 If it is within the words that would be captured by a special
; character then it is retained. However, it if is elsewhere in the
; phrase it must have a character in the pattern if it is not to fail.

; 16.11: a) 4 b) 15 c) 4 d) 5 e) 13 f) 8
; More special wildcards and wildcards near the beginning of the pattern
; make things more difficult

; 16.12 '(* *blank-known)

; 16.13 '(i like to listen to *band when i ?action) 
;       '(i like to listen to the beatles when i drive)

; you would end up with a blank word ("") inserted as a name in
; known-values ,which could create problems if there was more than one
; unnamed placeholder in the pattern. The part that prevents this is
; directly in the (add) function. It checks to see if the name is empty
; and only if it is not does it add it to known values.

; 16.15 Because they are both called by (lookup), which will check to
; see if known-values is empty. If it is, then neither will be called.
; If they are called, then they will both return a value before
; known-values is empty.

; 16.16 Because we want it to return #f if it is empty and howmany is
; not ? or *.

; 16.17 The call to (match-using-known-values) by the initial (match)

; 16.18 

; 1) The first words of the sent argument musut match the old value in
;    the database. '(?place me ?place) '(give me fun)

; 2) The partial pattern that remains after the placeholder must match
;    the rest fo the sentence. '(?blank for ?blank s sake) '(love for
;    love is doomed)

; 3) The old value must be consistent with the number of words permitted
;    by the howmany part of the placeholder. '(!adj men see &adj things)
;   '(funny men see very funny things)

; 16.19 It will fail because get-value will read the ! in known-values
; and return '(). We need someway to differentiate between the symbol !
; as used by the program and the symbol ! read a word from the sentence
; known-values/the placeholder.

; 16.20 and 16.21 have functions added to the "my_match.scm" file to
; enact these additional functionality. I probably should have written
; what I could have as seperate files and then made sure to document the
; other changes, but I am fairly happy with how they have worked out.

; (lambda (y) (+ n y)), where in is one of the values taken from the
