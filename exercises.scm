; the function i finds the average of all of the numbers in i. i must be a sentence or word of numbers. it can contain any kind of real numbers. it outputs a single number.

; accumulate takes a procedure(the first argument) and applies it to a sentence(the second argument) two words at a time. It continues to apply the procedure to the result and the next element in the sentence. It finishes when it has combined all of the words into a single result. That is the real power of this function, in that it takes all of the words of a sentence and combines them into a single meaningful(hopefully) result.

; repeated is a procedure that takes a procedure and a (positive?) integer as inputs. It outputs a procure that is the application of the input proceducre the input number of times.

;(repeated sqrt 3) This is a function that takes any number as an input and outputs a another number that is the 3rd square root of it. That is, it takes the square root of the input number, then takes the square root of that, then finally returns the square root of that.

; (repeated even? 2) This procedure will not function correctly, as it is trying to apply the even? procedure twice. However the output of the even? procedure is a boolean value and it expects an integer as the input.

;(repeated first 2) This procedure will take a word or sentence and output a word. If you give it a word it will return the first letter of the word, as the first letter of one letter is that letter. If the input is a sentence it will output the first letter of the first word, as it first applies the the first procedure to the sentence returning the first word. Then it applies the first procedure to that word. 

; (repeated (repeated bf 3) 2) This procedure will return all but the first six words of sentence and or all but the first six letters of word. The input can be either a word or sentence, and the output will be respective to the input.
